      "Although conventional wisdom predicts that passive investing will dominate the future, analysis of key trends indicates that active management will become more prevalent.\n",
      "The common narrative that passive investing will overtake active management suggests a primarily passive future for investors. However, an analysis of fund AUM data across time and regions offers a starkly different perspective on the future of investment management. Contrary to popular belief, active management assets under management (AUM) continues to far exceed those of passive index funds. Even though index fund AUM has seen a 1,500-fold increase from 1989, it still only represented 32% of all fund AUM by the end 2021. Assertions about passive investing overtaking active management are largely based upon a few exceptions – most notably for equity funds in the US Large Cap Blend category, where index funds contain three times as much AUM as their active counterparts. In other regions and across asset classes, index funds are not nearly as prevalent. Generalizations based on US Large Cap Blend equity funds are misleading.\n",

      "As the investment landscape evolves, proactive model validation is critical for the reliability and effectiveness of any investment process. This monograph provides a practical, detailed overview of validation tools available to practitioners.\n",
      "Building investment products is no different from building any other type of product: Great care must be taken to ensure that the product delivered to consumers is robust and reliable. Indeed, any investment professional who has researched, designed, and built investment products will attest to the importance of model validation because in any investment process, model validation is a critical component that underpins the reliability and effectiveness of investment strategies. As financial markets have become increasingly complex and dynamic, relying on models to make informed decisions has become commonplace. These models range from simple statistical models to sophisticated machine learning algorithms, all designed to analyze historical data and predict future market movements. However, the robustness of these models can be compromised by various factors, such as changing market conditions, unexpected events, and evolving investor behavior. Therefore, validating these models is imperative in order to ensure their relevance and performance in real-world scenarios. Model validation should be a proactive process that acknowledges the inherent uncertainties in financial markets and seeks to enhance the robustness and reliability of investment models. As the financial landscape continues to evolve, the importance of rigorous model validation processes will only grow. This monograph is designed to provide a practical yet detailed overview of the various model validation tools that investment practitioners have at their disposal. It seeks to contribute to the enhancement of investment product development by providing a comprehensive discussion of frameworks and techniques that can be used to assess the accuracy, reliability, and appropriateness of the models that drive investment processes.

      "Private equity is a $3 trillion asset class, attracting many investors. This literature review synthesizes the main insights of the academic literature on private equity, focusing on its performance, value creation, and key aspects for investors.\n",
      "Private equity (PE) has grown into a sizable asset class, with many institutional investors allocating significant portions of their portfolios to PE. This critical review of the academic literature focuses on PE funds that acquire mature companies. Topics covered include PE fund performance, value creation, and key aspects relevant to investors in PE funds. Regarding PE performance, PE funds have historically outperformed public market indices after fees, but it is unclear whether this outperformance persists when adjusted for risk, leverage, and illiquidity. Measuring performance, however, is complicated by the opaque and illiquid nature of the asset class.\n",

      "Using historical time-series data, this study investigates how serial dependence affects optimal portfolios. Analysis demonstrates that optimal allocations vary materially across investment periods.\n",
      "Describing the risks of an opportunity set of investments using only returns and covariances, which is common in approaches such as mean–variance optimization, implies that returns are independent (or random) across time. In reality, investments have historically exhibited varying levels of serial dependence, where the returns evolve nonrandomly for individual investments (i.e., autocorrelation) and across investments. This paper explores how the optimal allocation to equities, the value and small factors, and commodities has varied for different holding periods using actual historical time-series data, where optimal portfolios are determined using a utility function assuming constant relative risk aversion. The analysis demonstrates that optimal allocations can vary materially across investment periods, especially for more risk-averse investors who are concerned with inflation risk (e.g., retirees). Therefore, investment professionals need to actively consider serial dependence when building portfolios for clients to ensure these portfolios are best aligned to help clients accomplish their goals.\n",

As bank lending tightened due to stricter regulations after the 2008 global financial crisis, alternative credit gained increased traction—expanding to fill the void left by retreating financial institutions. Although alternative credit transactions vary greatly and lack standardized features, they broadly encompass transactions outside the traditional public fixed-income market.\n",

      "Economists have long held that financial planning should be based on life-cycle models, but financial planners have not adopted life-cycle finance. A practical, integrated three-stage model that incorporates life-cycle finance is proposed.\n",
      "For nearly three-quarters of a century, economists have strongly agreed that financial planning should be based on what are known as life-cycle models. At the heart of these life-cycle models is the relatively simple idea that to maximize lifetime utility, most people should save and invest some of their earnings during their working years to provide for their retirement, thus smoothing their inflation-adjusted consumption over their lifetimes. This idea goes back to Irving Fisher in 1930, and no less than eight Nobel Prizes (Samuelson 1970, Friedman 1976, Modigliani 1985, Becker 1992, Lucas 1995, Merton 1997, Fama 2013, and Deaton 2015) have gone to economists who did important work in life-cycle finance. Paradoxically, most financial planners and many investment textbooks are either unaware of or silent on life-cycle models and life-cycle finance. This book proposes a practical, integrated three-stage model for financial planning that not only embraces life-cycle finance but also integrates it with single-period optimization models. We make three primary contributions to optimal financial planning. Each of these three innovations represents a significant advancement in the implementation of life-cycle finance. Linking them into a cohesive three-stage model is a further advancement and is the most important aspect of our contribution to applied life-cycle finance.\n",

      "Held once a decade since 2001, the Equity Risk Premium Forum gathers leading investment minds to discuss new ERP research and key trends. The 2021 consensus was lower expected returns in the future.\n",
      "In 2001, Martin Leibowitz organized an Equity Risk Premium (ERP) Forum for CFA Institute, in which the participants discussed issues related to the ERP and made estimates for the future. This forum was repeated by Leibowitz, Brett Hammond, and Laurence Siegel in 2011, setting a precedent for a decennial forum. Siegel organized and moderated the discussion in 2021, and the proceedings from that event make up the current book. The participants in 2021 were (in alphabetical order) Robert Arnott, Clifford Asness, Mary Ida Compton, Elroy Dimson, William Goetzmann, Roger Ibbotson, Antti Ilmanen, Martin Leibowitz, Rajnish Mehra, Thomas Philips, and Jeremy Siegel. Each participant made a presentation, which was then discussed by the whole group. Finally, a roundtable discussion involving all of the participants was moderated by Laurence Siegel. Ibbotson and Dimson discussed historical returns in different countries. Ibbotson focused on the United States, while Dimson took a global industrial-country view. The history goes back almost a century (Ibbotson) or more than a century (Dimson), providing a look at how returns have evolved over a wide variety of conditions. Ibbotson also presented his method for making probabilistic forecasts of returns. Dimson, who is British, showed that “American exceptionalism” is one way to understand the results. Asness looked at the effectiveness of Robert Shiller’s CAPE (cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio) valuation measure for forecasting. Valuations rose over the period he studied, and a lively discussion was had about why this may have occurred. Arnott focused on the growth rate of dividends, which has been very slow in per-share terms, and argued (with much debate from the other participants) that buybacks are only a partial substitute for dividends. Leibowitz, also looking at valuation as the lodestone of return forecasts, set forth a “growth adjustment” that brought his forecast in line with those made by others. Compton, a consultant to pension plans, discussed the challenges of communicating lower expected returns to clients. She also emphasized that expected returns “don’t always come true,” they’re just someone’s best forecast. Ilmanen broke up the expected return into its component parts: dividends, real growth, inflation, and so forth. Doing this, he said, allows one to debate the estimates for each part and ascertain how accurate each of the estimates is. Philips started by presenting a method for forecasting bond returns. He then turned to equities, for which he compared forecasts with subsequent realizations using a variety of forecast methods. Mehra discussed a number of issues related to the existence of premiums (equity risk, value, small cap, and so forth) and concluded that, although some of these are unstable, the ERP is highly stable. Jeremy Siegel advocated a “back to basics” approach using dividend and earnings yields, dividend and earnings growth rates, payout ratios, and price-to-earnings ratios. He emphasized that earnings can be calculated in a number of different way, and said that accounting practices have become more conservative over the years. Goetzmann concluded the session by reporting that one company, a water mill in France, had almost 600 years of historical return data and that an asset pricing model could be tested using those data. According to this model, the stock price is the present value of expected future dividends and is supported by the evidence. In sum, because of high valuations and low interest rates, the participants expect lower total returns in the future than in the past. A forward-looking ERP of 4% to 5% was the consensus of the group.\n",

      "ESG strategies have experienced a massive inflow of capital over the past decade despite investors having little concrete evidence that ESG investing accomplishes its purported goals. It has also happened without investors having the information, tools, and methods needed to evaluate and communicate their specific ESG values, objectives, and preferences. Without evidence of efficacy and clearly articulated investment objectives, it is impossible for investors with ESG intent to know if they are getting what they are paying for, to distinguish between investment managers based on non-financial objectives, or to improve the likelihood of achieving positive ESG investing outcomes. This paper highlights key challenges faced by ESG investors and portfolio managers implementing ESG investment mandates. It then addresses these challenges focusing on relevant fund reporting, provides guidance on the information required to make informed ESG investing decisions, and proposes a performance evaluation and attribution framework to support the ESG investment management process.\n",

      "Current methods of assessing market and portfolio risk focus on short-term risk and cannot account for long-term dynamics of market risk and personal risk. This paper uses additional factors to extend current methods for long-term risks.\n",
      "The current methods used to assess market and portfolio risk extend back to the early 1990s. These methods were developed for banks and broker/dealers and then were adopted by the portfolio management and hedge fund community. This audience focuses on short-term risk, which is measured in days for the broker/dealer’s blotter and in months for hedge funds and investment managers. The current methods fail to reflect the dynamics that become increasingly important over the long term—dynamics that generate the periods of major downturns and instability that can derail lifestyle goals and even threaten basic financial security. These are the material risks for individuals and other asset owners. Unlike a bank or portfolio manager, risk comes at an individual from two directions: (1) the market risk that directly affects individual wealth and (2) the personal risk that comes from the uncertainty of life events and changes in risk tolerance and preferences. These interact to make an individual’s risk calculation complex and dynamic. Risk management for an individual is a moving target that is dynamic, multifaceted, and complex. We need a new approach to address it. One such approach is agent-based modeling. Agent-based models are used in fields in which complex dynamics are at work, from modeling traffic congestion on a highway to assessing the adequacy of exits for crowded venues, such as stadiums and arenas. Thus, it is not surprising that these are applicable to modeling material risk in financial markets. This paper starts by highlighting market characteristics that are relevant for material risk. It then discusses how to extend current risk methods to deal with these risks by using agent-based modeling and by considering the interactions of market risk as well as the risk coming from the asset owner.\n",

      "Once infrequently used, stock buybacks have become the dominant form of corporate payouts in the new century. Hundreds of billions of dollars flow from public companies to their shareholders via share repurchases every year. This literature review presents the main findings from the academic literature on stock buybacks in the United States and around the world. Where appropriate and possible, it compares and contrasts the insights of researchers to the views of practitioners.\n",
      "There has been much controversy about share repurchases in recent years. On the one hand, proponents of share repurchases say that this payout method provides liquidity and price support, returns excess cash in a flexible way, corrects undervaluation, and conveys information to the market. These aspects of buybacks are also often cited by practitioners as motivations for their share repurchase decisions. Academic research provides evidence that supports this view as well. On the other hand, opponents of buybacks argue that the practice may be used to manipulate executive compensation and mislead investors. While these aspects of share repurchase are rarely mentioned by corporate executives, academic research lends some credence to these concerns. Overall, academic researchers agree that while stock buybacks may be misused, this payout method has clear advantages. Hence, the challenge is to provide the right combination of oversight that allows companies to benefit from those advantages while minimizing potential costs. Finally, the studies surveyed in this review point out that a company’s buyback decision is tightly linked to many of its other policies, such as capital structure, compensation, risk management, and disclosure. Consequently, share repurchase policy discussions should also recognize the implications of the proposed changes for other corporate policies.

      "The fiscal theory of the price level (FTPL) solves puzzles raised by standard monetary theories. FTPL is forward looking and dynamic, and investors can use it to calculate the value of “money” through discounted free cash flow analysis.\n",
      "The fiscal theory of the price level (FTPL) provides an update and revision of monetary theory to address puzzles raised by the failure of both the new Keynesian theory (commonly used by central bankers) and neoclassical monetarism (in particular, the quantity theory of money as interpreted by Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz)—puzzles such as the low inflation that followed the sustained expansionary monetary policies post-2008. We aim to summarize and explain the FTPL as developed by Eric Leeper, John Cochrane, and others. The FTPL builds on neoclassical monetarism by observing that government liabilities—bonds, notes, bills, and currency—derive their value from the assets that back these liabilities. These assets are chiefly the present value of future tax revenues, minus government spending other than that part of spending used to service the liabilities themselves. This net “profit” of the government is called the primary surplus. This primary surplus can be expressed in real terms (a quantity of goods and services, rather than a money amount). The total real value of the bonds is thus the total real value of the assets backing the bonds: the present value of all future real primary surpluses (which we shorten to PVFS, present value of future surpluses). In a very important sense, the FTPL harkens back to commodity-based theories of money, except now the “commodity” is the real value of future surpluses earned by the government. We can then solve for the price level. It is simply the nominal value of the bonds (the face value or number of bonds issued) divided by the real value of the bonds (the PVFS). If the nominal value of the bonds is held constant and the underlying asset (PVFS) becomes less valuable, prices go up. If the PVFS becomes more valuable, prices go down. We thus calculate the value of “money” (including government liabilities of all maturities) the way one would calculate the value of any security: through discounted cash flow analysis. Note that this approach is consistent with the QTM because, if money is defined in the traditional way as currency and demand deposits and we now hold the PVFS (the backing of the money) constant, then the price level is proportional to the amount of money in circulation. The FTPL is a more complete theory, however, because (1) it incorporates all government liabilities, not traditional money alone, and (2) because it is forward-looking and dynamic rather than considering only conditions in the present.\n",

Estimating cost of capital in less-developed (i.e., “emerging”) economies can present an even greater challenge, primarily due to lack of data (or poor data quality) and the potential for magnified financial, economic, and political risks. A good understanding of cost of capital concepts is, therefore, essential for making global investment decisions.\n",

      "American workers rely on their employers to provide a way to generate retirement income beyond their Social Security earnings. Many employers still offer traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plans. A growing majority, however, have replaced DB plans with account-based defined contribution (DC) plans. Virtually everyone acknowledges that the basic DC plan design is flawed. Yet as a society with low private savings and a fraying Social Security system, we count on this imperfect structure to serve as a retirement security bulwark. Workers and society both need the employer-sponsored retirement system to function well. Enhancing DC plan design therefore becomes critical. Defined Contribution Plans: Challenges and Opportunities for Plan Sponsors offers guidance to plan sponsors interested in better understanding the primary issues confronting DC plans. We wrote this book from the viewpoint of the plan sponsor seeking to improve the DC system, and it follows five major themes: the plan participant, the plan sponsor, plan design, investments and investment managers, and asset decumulation in retirement. We present the material conversationally from a high-level perspective. We have not sought to write an encyclopedia on DC plans but rather focus on the basic features of well-run plans. We address key challenges facing DC plans and offer associated design and policy recommendations for plan sponsors and other interested parties to consider. Plan design improvements almost certainly will be incremental, rather than sweeping top-down changes mandated by regulators. Plan sponsors individually will make the important decisions that have lasting consequences for participants and for society. Our objective is to spark interest among sponsors, encouraging them to carry out additional research and take action. We believe the DC system will be strengthened by informed sponsors advocating for and implementing thoughtful strategic changes to their plans.\n",

      "In recorded financial history, there are almost no occasions, other than the present, where a significant portion of the global bond markets has been trading at negative nominal yields. Is this an anomaly or what will be the normal state of the financial markets in years to come? This monograph investigates the ongoing debate between the pros and cons of negative nominal yields and the economic rationale(s) that are used to justify or criticize underlying policies. Even in academic circles, few agree on the costs and benefits of negative yields. Surveying the global bond markets of the day, I find the impact of negative yields in almost all regions and sectors, though sovereign bond markets, which are closest to monetary policy, are the dominant category of bonds with negative yields. I next look at the participants in the negatively yielding bond market and at the motivations that justify their actions. The conclusion is that although different participants might have different reasons to buy negatively yielding bonds, their collective action is certainly responsible for creating a local equilibrium in which these markets clear. I next look at the participants in the negatively yielding bond market and at the motivations that justify their actions. The conclusion is that although different participants might have different reasons to buy negatively yielding bonds, their collective action is certainly responsible for creating a local equilibrium in which these markets clear. Central bank policy is the next focus in this monograph, and I discuss in depth the economic rationale as propounded by one such bank, the European Central Bank. I conclude with a discussion of the blurring lines between monetary and fiscal policy, which are likely to become centerpieces in future years as global sovereign debt levels rise. Next, I look at the influence of negative yields on other asset markets, such as equities, and especially derivatives markets, such as the demand for options. A discussion of potential risks then follows. The monograph concludes with a review of the impact of negative yields on nonfinancial aspects of society. Although the forecast is anything but crystal clear, the evolution of markets and economics in the years to come will undoubtedly be influenced by this massive economic experiment of negative yields.\n",

      "Many have argued that the 21st century will be the Asian Century. And yet many capital markets in Asia, particularly emerging markets, remain a mystery to much of the outside world. We hope this brief will help to fill that knowledge gap. The MSCI Emerging Markets Asia Index, launched at the beginning of the century, includes nine markets today. The relatively large and liquid capital markets of China (A shares), South Korea, and Taiwan are better known in global markets partly because of the international success of local tech giants. This brief covers the remaining six markets in the index—India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand—plus five other up-and-coming Asian markets—Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. In each chapter, local authors review the history, current characteristics, and challenges and opportunities of their respective capital markets. The selected countries exhibit certain economic and financial similarities. Having traveled to the majority of the covered countries, we believe they also have another important attribute in common: hope. These countries witnessed how neighbors such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and, more recently, China have improved living standards for their people since the 1960s. Their citizens share a strong belief that hard work will pay off. So, despite conditions that many from developed markets may find challenging, throughout these countries you can hear the upbeat tone in the voices and see the smiles on the faces of people going about their business. Still, these markets are substantially different in many ways. We venture three differences here to highlight the practical value of this brief: Still, these markets are substantially different in many ways.

      "Today’s investors need to understand geopolitical trends as a main driving force of markets. This book provides just that: an understanding of the interplay between geopolitics and economics, and of the impact of that dynamic on financial markets. To me, geo-economics is the study of how geopolitics and economics interact in international relations. Plenty of books on geopolitics have been written by eminent experts in politics and international affairs. This book is not one of them. First, I am neither a political scientist nor an expert in international affairs. I am an economist and an investment strategist who has been fascinated by geopolitics for many years. And this fascination has led me to the realization that almost all books and articles written on geopolitics are useless for investors. Political scientists are not trained to think like investors, and they are not typically trained in quantitative methods. Instead, they engage in developing narratives for geopolitical events and processes that pose risks and opportunities for investors. First, I am neither a political scientist nor an expert in international affairs. I am an economist and an investment strategist who has been fascinated by geopolitics for many years. And this fascination has led me to the realization that almost all books and articles written on geopolitics are useless for investors. Political scientists are not trained to think like investors, and they are not typically trained in quantitative methods. Instead, they engage in developing narratives for geopolitical events and processes that pose risks and opportunities for investors. My main problem with these narratives is that they usually do not pass the “so what?” test. Geopolitical risks are important, but how am I to assess which risks are important for my portfolio and which ones are simply noise? Because geopolitics experts focus on politics, they do not provide an answer to this crucial question for investors. What could be important for a geopolitics expert and for global politics could be totally irrelevant for investors. For example, the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been going on for almost two decades now and have been an important influence on the political discussion in the United States. But for investors, the war in Afghanistan was a total nonevent, and the war in Iraq had only a fleeting influence, when it started in 2003. Geopolitics experts cannot answer the question of which geopolitical events matter for investors and which do not. Unfortunately, some experts thus claim that all geopolitical risks matter and that these risks cannot be quantified but only assessed qualitatively. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the chapters that follow, I discuss geopolitical and geo-economic events from the viewpoint of an investor and show that they can be quantified and introduced as part of a traditional risk management process. I do this in two parts. The first part of this book focuses on geopolitics that matters to investors. It reviews the literature on a range of geopolitical events and shows which events have a material economic effect and which do not. The second part of this book puts the insights from those first chapters into practice by applying them to current geopolitical trends. In this second part, I stick my head out and examine the impact the geopolitical trends have on the economy and financial markets today and their likely development in the coming years. —Joachim Klement, CFA Contents:\n",

      "The presence of speculative bubbles in capital markets (an important area of interest in financial history) is widely accepted across many circles. Talk of them is pervasive in the media and especially in the popular financial press. Bubbles are thought to be found primarily in the stock market, which is our main interest, although bubbles are said to occur in other markets. Bubbles go hand in hand with the notion that markets can be irrational. The academic community has a great interest in bubbles, and it has produced scholarly literature that is voluminous. For some economists, doing bubble research is like joining the vanguard of a Kuhnian paradigm shift in economic thinking. Not so fast. If bubbles did exist, they would pose a serious challenge to neoclassical finance. Bubbles would contradict the ideas that markets are rational or work in an informationally efficient manner. That’s what makes the topic of bubbles interesting. This book reviews and evaluates the academic literature as well as some popular investment books on the possible existence of speculative bubbles in the stock market. The main question is whether there is convincing empirical evidence that bubbles exist. A second question is whether the theoretical concepts that have been advanced for bubbles make them plausible. This book reviews and evaluates the academic literature as well as some popular investment books on the possible existence of speculative bubbles in the stock market. The main question is whether there is convincing empirical evidence that bubbles exist. A second question is whether the theoretical concepts that have been advanced for bubbles make them plausible. The reader will discover that I am skeptical that bubbles actually exist. But I do not think I or anyone else will ever be able to conclusively prove that there has never been a bubble. From studying the literature and from reading history, I find that many famous purported bubbles reflect inaccurate history or mistakes in analysis or simply cannot be shown to have existed. In other instances, bubbles might have existed. But in each of those cases, there are credible rational explanations. And good evidence exists for the idea that even if bubbles do exist, they are not of great importance to understanding the stock market.\n",

This monograph appraises the quality of surveyed studies by determining how well each deals with key conceptual issues and how adequately each addresses principal risks.

      "ESG and Responsible Institutional Investing Around the World: A Critical Review\n",
      "This survey examines the vibrant academic literature on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. While there is no consensus on the exact list of ESG issues, responsible investors increasingly assess stocks in their portfolios based on nonfinancial data on environmental impact (e.g., carbon emissions), social impact (e.g., employee satisfaction), and governance attributes (e.g., board structure). The objective is to reduce exposure to investments that pose greater ESG risks or to influence companies to become more sustainable. One active area of research at present involves assessing portfolio risk exposure to climate change.\n",
      "This literature review focuses on institutional investors, which have grown in importance such that they have now become the largest holders of shares in public companies globally. Historically, institutional investors tended to concentrate their ESG efforts mostly on corporate governance (the “G” in ESG). These efforts included seeking to eliminate provisions that restrict shareholder rights and enhance managerial power, such as staggered boards, supermajority rules, golden parachutes, and poison pills. In addition, this review of ESG literature determines the following: Readers might come away from this survey skeptical about the potential for ESG investing to affect positive change. I prefer to characterize the current state of the literature as having a “healthy dose of skepticism,” with much more remaining to be explored. Here, I hope the reader comes away with a call to action. For the industry practitioner, I believe that the investment industry should strive to achieve positive societal goals. CFA Institute provides an exemplary case in its Future of Finance series. For the academic community, I suggest we ramp up research aimed at tackling some of the open questions around the pressing societal goals of ESG investing. I am optimistic that practitioners and academics will identify meaningful ways to better harness the power of global financial markets for addressing the pressing ESG issues facing our society.\n",

      "ETFs and Systemic Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) revolutionized asset markets by using an innovative structure to make investing in a wide variety of asset classes simpler and cheaper. When first introduced, ETFs were viewed as a sideshow in the market, but their spectacular growth, combined with recent episodes of market instability, raises troubling concerns that these products may now pose new risks to market stability and performance. But are ETFs actually the culprit in destabilizing market dynamics, or are they merely innocent bystanders in today’s complex market environment? This paper examines whether ETFs affect systemic risks in financial markets and, if they do, what the mechanism is by which this impact occurs. We review current research and empirical evidence on these issues and discuss some of the systemic risks that may relate to ETFs’ particular design. Among the issues considered are the impacts of ETFs on market close, the problems raised by underlying asset illiquidity, market concentration at various levels of the ETF food chain, and step-away risks from authorized participants. We compare various tools a regulator can use to deal with these potential systemic effects, as well as some current regulatory initiatives. We draw attention to several emerging risks, such as those arising from the increased use of ETFs as cash substitutes. We conclude that ETFs can be a source of systemic risk, in large part because these assets can induce important feedback effects in markets. We also conclude that these effects can be greatly mitigated by careful regulatory oversight and identify various actions one can take to keep the risks under control. Our paper raises the intriguing question of whether we have the right “rules of the road” to deal with the new drivers of market behavior.\n",

      "US labor productivity has been stagnating since 2005 onward, averaging growth of only 1.3% a year since then, as opposed to 2.8% annual growth over the previous decade starting in 1995. The United States is not alone: According to McKinsey & Company data, labor productivity growth rates remain near historic lows in many other advanced economies. The slowdown in productivity growth in these economies is a problem—and a puzzle. The Productivity Puzzle: Restoring Economic Dynamism, edited by David E. Adler and Laurence B. Siegel, is an anthology of essays about this mysterious stagnation in productivity. It provides new policy solutions in addition to analyses of the problem. The book’s central innovation is that it is interdisciplinary. Traditional macroeconomics has trouble fully explaining the productivity puzzle because the sources of productivity growth often lie in a country’s specific economic practices and institutions. These institutional differences are better captured by political economists, historians, and social thinkers than by macroeconomists. But productivity also has macroeconomic components, including interest rate regimes and terms and amounts of trade, which are typically missing from political or institutional analyses. That is, neither the macroeconomic nor the institutional approach is adequate to fully capture all the drivers of productivity growth. As a result, the anthology consists of authors writing from multiple perspectives, not just mainstream economics or finance. The book offers analyses that investors may be unfamiliar with, including statistical debates about productivity measurement and the decline in US manufacturing employment, little-known interest rate mechanisms that might drive misallocations of the economy to lower productivity sectors, and institutional deficiencies in the US innovation “system” that make it hard for those in the United States to translate academic research into actual manufacturing processes as is done in Germany and Japan. The book offers analyses that investors may be unfamiliar with, including statistical debates about productivity measurement and the decline in US manufacturing employment, little-known interest rate mechanisms that might drive misallocations of the economy to lower productivity sectors, and institutional deficiencies in the US innovation “system” that make it hard for those in the United States to translate academic research into actual manufacturing processes as is done in Germany and Japan. Essays in the anthology explore whether the United States is still a start-up nation, implications for the economy of the rise of superstar firms, and finally, whether the United States is abandoning its commitment to free market competition. The increase in market concentration means that cellphone plans, internet service, and airline tickets are now more expensive in the United States than in Europe. Contributors to the book come from a variety of backgrounds and tend to have a global perspective. They include central bankers, political scientists who study innovation, financial economists, and the Nobel Laureate Edmund Phelps. The book consists in part of the proceedings from the landmark conference on productivity and dynamism, organized by the editors, that took place at the Museum of American Finance in New York in November 2017 and of which the CFA Institute Research Foundation was a sponsor, along with other firms and organizations. These proceedings have been augmented here by essays relevant to the topic, selected by the editors. These new analyses present innovation solutions to the problems the book discusses. Understanding the drivers of productivity stagnation and growth is vitally important for everyone, including investors. As Paul Krugman has said, “Productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run, it is almost everything.” We are thus very pleased to present The Productivity Puzzle: Restoring Economic Dynamism. We believe it is a substantial contribution to the literature on the sources of, and obstacles to, economic progress.\n",

      "The Context Investors fear return uncertainty and drawdowns associated with owning relatively risky asset classes, such as equity. The fact that greater risk is associated with greater expected return does not preclude the possibility that realized returns may be far less than a low-risk asset could provide, even with horizons as long as 5 to 10 years. Fear prompts the average investor to sometimes act against his own best interest. Therefore, the average investor’s portfolio often underperforms a static benchmark, even before fees. The average investor tends to increase allocation to riskier assets after the market has already significantly risen and decrease allocation after a significant decline. Given that financial planning in the context of retirement is a multidecade endeavor that can last 50 years or more, investors face an additional challenge. Financial planners cannot be concerned solely with “managing” the behavior of investors facing short-term return uncertainty, which remains an important challenge, but must also be concerned with how to address longer-term uncertainties. For example, there is significant uncertainty about the assumption for long-term expected returns, real as well as nominal. Some lucky investors may accumulate much of their wealth before retirement during an exceptionally strong bull market (e.g., 1982 to 2000), whereas less fortunate investors may have been planning to retire in 2008 or early 2009, just after the most dramatic global liquidity crisis since the Great Depression and a significant decline in interest rates. Moreover, average expected returns represent only part of the story. Some investors may have recorded above-average returns at a time when their accumulated wealth was already significant, whereas others may have recorded above-average returns when their accumulated wealth was low. The implication of the interactions among savings patterns (in accumulation), withdrawal patterns (in decumulation), and timing of above- and below-average portfolio returns is important to understand, particularly with respect to how the interactions should affect the allocation policy. Furthermore, investors face significant risks in the transition period—say, the last 5 to 10 years—from accumulation to decumulation. Considering the uncertainty in long-term expected returns, patterns of returns, and patterns of savings, it is unlikely that a financial plan established when an individual is 30 years old can remain static thereafter. The plan must be revaluated periodically, which requires an effective feedback mechanism or tool. The investor has many more options available before retirement, however, although some may not necessarily be pleasant. In the event of lower than expected accumulated wealth, the investor could decide to save more, postpone retirement, and/or adjust retirement plans. These options may be unavailable or may be harder to implement once the decision to retire has been made. The investor must implement a transition strategy that reduces the likelihood and/or significance of the unplanned adjustments that may be necessary as the targeted or desired retirement date draws near.

The investor must implement a transition strategy that reduces the likelihood and/or significance of the unplanned adjustments that may be necessary as the targeted or desired retirement date draws near. In addition, longevity remains uncertain, and retirement plans often are based on expected longevity. Even though the median life expectancy for a 65-year-old individual in the United States is 83.3 years for men and 85.9 years for women, a significant percentage of people will live past age 90. Furthermore, as someone ages, the older she is expected to live. A dynamic issue, life expectancy becomes even more complicated in the context of a couple—one or both individuals could live a very long time. This possibility should also influence the allocation policy over time and the potential need for longevity insurance. Finally, governments in many countries have implemented policies and programs to support the retirement effort. The most important program in the United States is Social Security, but its purpose is to provide only a minimum level of inflation-adjusted income, not to sustain the standard of living that an individual had before retirement. Other programs seek to encourage savings and facilitate wealth accumulation, such as 401(k)s, traditional and Roth IRAs (Registered Retirement Savings Plans and Tax-Free Savings Accounts in Canada), and health savings accounts (HSAs). Most investors, however, underestimate the savings effort required to maintain the standard of living to which they are accustomed, cannot implement a comprehensive and coherent adaptive retirement plan, cannot optimize across all relevant parameters, and lack access to the feedback mechanism needed to make the appropriate adjustments over time. Secure Retirement and Other Literature Many books on retirement planning have been published in recent years. Almost exclusively, they cover general issues of retirement preparedness, public policy, asset allocation and asset location principles, and lifestyle recommendations. These books provide useful guidelines and simple investment rules of thumb. Recommendations are often based on relatively simple analytics, sometimes illustrated in a single-period context, and/or are supported by referring to more in-depth studies published in academic journals or business research. For example, CFA Institute published a comprehensive literature review titled Longevity Risk and Retirement Income Planning,[1] which aggregates much of the relevant literature. Currently, however, no book links the academic and business research on the most relevant dimensions of retirement planning—such as risk in accumulation and decumulation, longevity risk, longevity products, asset allocation, taxation, and measures of utility—and tests this research within an integrated and realistic empirical framework. Furthermore, some aspects of retirement planning have been insufficiently researched. For example, although how to better manage risk in decumulation is currently a focus of interest, the nature of risk in accumulation and how it should affect allocation policy are still not well understood by most investors. Improving retirement planning is therefore a complex challenge that requires a comprehensive and integrated theoretical and empirical effort. As Robert Merton said in a 2017 interview, “The retirement problem is a global problem. The good news is, finance science can be used to solve it. Design things on finance principles, rather than institutionally…. If you design on financial principles, it will work everywhere in the world.”[2] Designing a solution to the retirement problem based on financial principles is the goal of Secure Retirement. Although written in the context of US (and, at times, Canadian) investors, its principles are universal. Secure Retirement is written not only for sophisticated investors and financial advisers but also for those interested in creating more informationally efficient web-based retirement platforms. Its findings can be applied to all investors, although the investments of individuals with super-high net worth require greater complexity with respect to assets and asset classes, insurance products, taxation, and legal framework. The Content The material of Secure Retirement is concentrated in seven core chapters, Chapters 2 to 8. The introductory chapter (Chapter 1) frames the main issues and the scope of this book. The concluding chapter (Chapter 9) explores improvements that should eventually be integrated into this effort but would require new research and highly advanced quantitative methodologies, such as machine-learning models and algorithms.\n",

      "The primary objective of perpetual endowment funds and long-lived trust funds is to generate spendable cash. Ideally, these cash disbursements would be stable from one year to the next and would grow to keep pace with inflation. Too-high disbursements today would lead to too-low disbursements tomorrow, and vice versa. Setting a proper spending rate is difficult. Trustees often set percentage spending rates based on the real returns they expect to earn from their investments and then link those spending rates to their funds’ market values. But linking spending to market values causes problems. One problem is that market values of common asset classes, such as stocks and bonds, are volatile. Trustees fight this volatility by averaging market values over time, but averaging does not work very well. Another problem is that trustees who base spending on market values often understandably come to believe that market values themselves determine spending. In other words, if market values increase (or fall) by a significant amount, then trustees feel justified in increasing (or cutting) spending by similar amounts. This belief is misguided. For equities, the predominant asset class in most endowment and trust funds, the source of returns is not market values but, rather, corporate profits. Another problem is that trustees who base spending on market values often understandably come to believe that market values themselves determine spending. In other words, if market values increase (or fall) by a significant amount, then trustees feel justified in increasing (or cutting) spending by similar amounts. This belief is misguided. For equities, the predominant asset class in most endowment and trust funds, the source of returns is not market values but, rather, corporate profits. This brief argues that, counter to common practice, trustees should turn their backs on market values and instead focus on the real cash flows that their assets can generate. For bonds, this would mean their real interest rate. For equities, this would mean their underlying profits. This focus on asset cash flows, rather than on asset market values, is a better way to go. This brief offers two spending rules based on cash flows. One looks at corporate dividends, and the other at corporate profits. Trustees who base spending on market values usually include bonds in their funds to dampen market value swings. A 30% bond allocation is not uncommon. Yet the cash-flow spending rules described here lead to less volatile spending, even when applied to a 100% equity portfolio, than that of a 30% bond/70% equity portfolio whose spending is based on market values. In addition, spending rules based on cash flows free trustees from fretting about market values. Diversification can still be beneficial, but no longer do trustees need to diversify primarily to dampen market downturns. When equity market values decline, as they invariably will from time to time, trustees may be able to say, “We don’t care.” Furthermore, spending rules based on cash flows enable trustees to keep score. Trustees of perpetual endowment funds and of long-lived personal trust funds often feel obligated to be intergenerationally equitable—that is, to treat current and future beneficiaries the same. The near-universal way to evaluate intergenerational equity is to look at market values. Instead, a spending rule based on cash flows works better. Finally, basing spending on cash flows, rather than on market values, encourages trustees to focus on something that is very important but often overlooked: the long-term health of the economies in which their funds are invested. No spending rule is perfect. But many trustees who now base spending on market values would benefit by focusing on asset cash flows instead.\n",

      "Endowments are a substantial category of institutional investors. Some of these have been on the forefront of moving into new asset classes and new strategies, outperforming many other investors. What are the factors of success and lessons learned?\n",
      "Endowments have been important for society in their role of supporting good causes over long time horizons. Some of them have a long history of more than five centuries. Today, endowments represent an important class of institutional investors. This article focuses on university endowments, which have been at the forefront of exploring new investment styles and asset classes. Some of these endowments have reported outstanding risk-adjusted returns, which allowed them to strongly support their university financially. On the one hand, these institutions enjoy supportive characteristics that allow them to seek new investment opportunities. First, endowments do not need to fear fund withdrawals. Second, their investment horizon is perpetual, and third, endowments enjoy a special network among their stakeholders. On the other hand, the investment strategy should be consistent with the spending strategy and the fundraising strategy of the endowment. This needs to be continuously monitored within the governance structure of the endowment, which could limit its investment possibilities. Interestingly, not all university endowments have enjoyed above-market returns. Comparing the average American university endowment with a simple 60% US stock and 40% US bond allocation reveals a similar return and volatility behavior. As with other institutional investors, only a small number of leading institutions are able to exploit the special characteristics universities endowments could potentially enjoy. To make use of the full range of investment opportunities, an endowment needs to have access to skilled asset managers and sophisticated investment approaches, which depends on the endowment’s size and the network of the institution.

If an endowment has access to such factors, it should be able to generate sustainable, above-market risk-adjusted returns over the long run. If this is not the case, the observation of endowments empirically supports the main advice of financial theory: Diversify and keep asset management costs at a minimum.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tontines and similar mortality-pooled investment arrangements offer a useful and unique value proposition to the global retirement challenge. A tontine is a financial arrangement in which members form an asset pool and agree to receive payouts from it while living and to forfeit their accounts upon death. Forfeited balances are then apportioned among the surviving members. So, members earn not only investment returns but also mortality credits for as long as they survive. A key feature of tontines is that they pool the longevity risk of their members. Pooling diversifies the risk and allows members the assurance of lifetime income. Because they offer no guarantees, payouts will vary depending on investment performance and the mortality experience of the membership pool. Dispensing with the cost of guarantees allows tontines to be cheaper than comparable insurance products. The study of tontine design has emerged recently as a specialty of its own. The discipline represents a paradigm shift relative to the disciplines of either traditional investments or insurance. A first step in the study of tontine design is to understand the fair tontine principle.1 The principle is quite strict. Yet, as a string enables a strictly bounded kite much freedom to soar, adherence to the fair tontine principle likewise enables the designer a significant (and perhaps surprising) amount of freedom.

      "Ten Years After: Reflections on the Global Financial Crisis\n",
      "This brief is based on a conference that marked the 10-year anniversary of the global financial crisis. It explores the origins of and response to the crisis and the lessons learned from it.\n",
      "The “Ten Years After” Brief contains summaries of research articles and central banker discussions from the “2008 Financial Crisis: A Ten-Year Review” conference that took place in November 2018 in New York City. The full versions of the articles were published by the Annual Review of Financial Economics, and actual live conference sessions can be accessed via the CFA Institute website. The summaries in the Brief, which are short descriptions of the original articles, are intended for practitioners and investors interested in learning about the current status of academic research related to the 2008 financial crisis. An edited and annotated transcript of a conversation between central bankers Ben Bernanke, Lord Mervyn King, and Jean-Claude Trichet about the crisis makes the Brief of particular interest. The 11 articles summarized in the Brief provide an overview of recent research that not only offers insights into the 2008 crisis but also describes lines of inquiry and findings that go beyond understanding the origins of the global financial crisis. In “Deglobalization: The Rise of Disembedded Unilateralism,” Harold James describes the growing opposition to globalization in the wake of the crisis, with an associated decline in cross-border investing and international trade. However, he notes that opposition to globalization may lead to its reform and resurgence. In “Deglobalization: The Rise of Disembedded Unilateralism,” Harold James describes the growing opposition to globalization in the wake of the crisis, with an associated decline in cross-border investing and international trade. However, he notes that opposition to globalization may lead to its reform and resurgence. Gary Gorton relates financial crises to the vulnerability of short-term debt, broadly defined. This vulnerability is inherent in market economies because maturity transformation is an essential function of banks, which in turn are necessary for market economies to exist. Therefore, financial crises have occurred repeatedly over history.  Christopher L. Foote and Paul S. Willen review research on mortgage default, which policymakers need to understand better to more effectively respond to financial crises. They note that research supports the view that payment forbearance is an effective way to reduce default. However, defaults by individual borrowers are difficult to predict because they depend on loss-of-income shocks that are unforecastable.  Manuel Adelino, Antoinette Schoar, and Felipe Severino indicate why a proper diagnosis of the reasons for the 2008 financial crisis is necessary to prevent a repeat in the future. They analyze the origins of the crisis and unveil evidence that contradicts some popular beliefs. They conclude that regulators should consider time-varying capital requirements and countercyclical loan-to-value requirements. Matthew Richardson, Kermit L. Schoenholtz, and Lawrence J. White critically discuss the following three levers of recent prudential regulation: capital requirements, liquidity requirements, and regulation of scope. They emphasize that regulators should select the most cost-effective tools to reduce systemic risk. Andrew Metrick and June Rhee provide an overview of reforms that occurred after the financial crisis, organizing their presentation into three types of reforms: preventative, emergency, and restructuring powers. They note that the main effect of the new reforms has been to shift power from emergency into preventative and restricting powers but that some of the new rules are complex and untested. Deborah Lucas reviews the cost and beneficiaries of the bailouts that took place during the 2008 financial crisis, providing rigor and clarity to the controversy surrounding those bailouts. Tobias Adrian, John Kiff, and Hyun Song Shin review the causes of bank deleveraging following the crisis, making the case that reasons other than increased regulation have been the main cause of deleveraging. Furthermore, they organize post-2008 regulatory reforms around four objectives and conclude that further research is needed on their unintended consequences. Zhiguo He and Arvind Krishnamurthy offer an introduction to the new and growing literature on asset pricing models based on frictions incurred by financial intermediaries.  Robert Engle reviews the impact on financial crises of undercapitalization of financial firms and of the ability of the financial system to withstand the risk created by undercapitalized institutions (risk capacity). He shows evidence that systemic risk has been reduced dramatically since the financial crisis. Stephen G. Ryan reviews recent research connecting financial reporting and financial stability. Specifically, he organizes and reviews the evidence around the following three channels: capital requirement violations, banks’ risk management and control systems, and the discipline of markets and regulators over banks. In the “Central Banker Roundtable,” which was moderated by Stanley Fischer, central bankers Ben Bernanke, Lord Mervyn King, and Jean-Claude Trichet provided their views and firsthand accounts of the global financial crisis. The roundtable touched on such topics as the cause and depth of the crisis, the tools available to fight it, the speed of international transmission, and the unprecedented informal coordination among central banks. Other topics covered included the need to regulate maturity transformation and moral hazard and the future of central bank independence.  The topics covered in the roundtable and in the research articles are intertwined and complementary. As a result, the Brief provides an easy-to-read, yet rigorous, assessment of the most relevant research on the global financial crisis, 10 years after it occurred.\n",

      "Investment Governance for Fiduciaries\n",
      "\n",
      "Governance is a word that is increasingly heard and read in modern times, be it corporate governance, global governance, or investment governance. Investment governance, the central concern of this modest volume, refers to the effective employment of resources—people, policies, processes, and systems—by an individual or governing body (the fiduciary or agent) seeking to fulfill their fiduciary duty to a principal (or beneficiary) in addressing an underlying investment challenge. Effective investment governance is an enabler of good stewardship, and for this reason it should, in our view, be of interest to all fiduciaries, no matter the size of the pool of assets or the nature of the beneficiaries. To emphasize the importance of effective investment governance and to demonstrate its flexibility across organization type, we consider our investment governance process within three contexts: defined contribution (DC) plans, defined benefit (DB) plans, and endowments and foundations (E&Fs). Since the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the financial sector’s place in the economy and its methods and ethics have (rightly, in many cases) been under scrutiny. Coupled with this theme, the task of investment governance is of increasing importance due to the sheer weight of money, the retirement savings gap, demographic trends, regulation and activism, and rising standards of behavior based on higher expectations from those fiduciaries serve. These trends are at the same time related and self-reinforcing. Having explored the why of investment governance, we dedicate the remainder of the book to the question of how to bring it to bear as an essential component of good fiduciary practice. At this point, the reader might expect investment professionals to launch into a discussion about an investment process focused on the best way to capture returns. We resist this temptation. Instead, we contend that achieving outcomes on behalf of beneficiaries is as much about managing risks as it is about capturing returns—and we mean “risks” broadly construed, not just fluctuations in asset values. Having explored the why of investment governance, we dedicate the remainder of the book to the question of how to bring it to bear as an essential component of good fiduciary practice. At this point, the reader might expect investment professionals to launch into a discussion about an investment process focused on the best way to capture returns. We resist this temptation. Instead, we contend that achieving outcomes on behalf of beneficiaries is as much about managing risks as it is about capturing returns—and we mean “risks” broadly construed, not just fluctuations in asset values. The metaphor we use for this investment governance process thus emphasizes the defensive aspects of solving the investment challenge, especially defending the beneficiary from risk events and/or uncompensated risks (as well as capturing returns). Given the uncertainty involved in investment decision making, the fiduciary investor is left to rely on a robust process. To underscore the idea of defense, we have adopted a Latin word used to describe field defenses, operis, as the way to remember the key steps of our investment process. OPERIS spells out the steps in the process—Objective, Policy, Execute and Resource, Implement, Superintend—and we devote the remainder of this volume to exploring the how of investment governance with reference to our three organizational contexts: DC plans, DB plans, and E&Fs. By the end of the book, we hope it will be clear to the reader that the individual fiduciary and the governing body to which the fiduciary is appointed each face a difficult task. How might one both represent the interests of beneficiaries and make complex investment decisions in the presence of uncertainty and competing interests? In such a context, we submit that a high probability of success is perhaps the best that can be hoped for. We set out to provide fiduciaries with some ideas that might help them increase the probability of success. Almost all our suggestions point to the need for a good process that is defensible, repeatable, and documented and that can be used as evidence of diligence in fulfilling the role of fiduciary. Applied diligently by the fiduciary body through time, this process seeks to maximize the probability of achieving the objectives set on behalf of beneficiaries. In making the case for good process, we offer a high-level outline of the process we use when consulting and counseling our fiduciary clients. We find that this process provides a nearly universal blueprint for addressing the issues investors face, noting that the investment challenge—and the investment policy statement that flows from it—can vary widely depending on the context and/or the nature of the beneficiary. We are the first to emphasize that we are not advocating our process as the only possible path to defensible fiduciary practice. Instead, we contend that is more important to have a process than to necessarily have this process. This book is the fruit of the last 25 years or so of professional experience across industry and academia, during which we have worked—mostly with each other—on matters of investment governance. Our professional collaboration began when we worked as the senior investment governance officers of a pension fund that offered both DB and DC plans and where the investment function was substantially delegated to external parties (some of which were related). The investment governance ecosystem in which this fund existed was formative in our views on the subject. We began as staff acting as gatekeepers for lay fiduciaries, faced with the best (and worst) the industry has to offer during the best and worst of times (including the global financial crisis). Now, as independent consultants and fiduciaries, we see the same issues from a slightly different perspective. Some of our views have been confirmed, others challenged. What has become patently obvious to us is that good process has common elements and (near) universal application irrespective of the fiduciary role and the underlying investment challenge. A book about investment governance for fiduciaries is important because the task they face is of increasing importance the world over. Fiduciaries are trusted with being stewards of other people’s money, money that has been set aside for important societal purposes, be that the retirement savings of thousands of workers, the wealth of nations, or the legacy and good works of a charity.\n",

      "Relationship Alpha\n",
      "\n",
      "Book knowledge and behavioral finance expertise can take a firm only so far. Although so-called soft skills are often dismissed as less important than “hard” analytical skills, relationship alpha (α) is a reinvention of the client experience. By balancing the power of EQ (the emotional quotient) with IQ, advisors can use relationship a to enhance every aspect of their client relationships—for the benefit of both the clients and the firm. Earning trust is only the first step; engaging the client (or prospective client) in a genuine dialogue is next and creates true relationship α. Such a dialogue sounds nothing like a skilled analyst drilling down into a company’s balance sheet with the CFO. Private clients rarely respond well to such intense examination because their wealth often inspires a fear of being “taken” or fooled, so any dialogue requires skills beyond the tired script of the traditional salesperson. Within this brief are training exercises for a firm’s professionals, the tool of quadrants of sophistication and control for inspiring a dialogue, and five questions to ask clients in order maintain relationship α. Also included are ways to design more successful client reports and create more engaging client meetings. More controversial in this brief is the author’s call for a firm to reexamine several assumptions embraced yesterday but damaging to any firm in today’s competitive market. For example, not every senior professional of a firm is suited for the initial marketing to a prospect. Not every CFA charterholder, brand-new or veteran, can learn how to effectively interact with clients. Relationship α requires a continual and rigorous review of the client experience within the context of each firm’s unique constraints and resources. Citing examples from the most successful advisors, this brief serves as a step-by-step guide toward transformation of an advisory practice—moving from an archaic business model under attack into a profitable firm inspired by a clear code of conduct, true engagement of all professionals, and highly satisfied clients.\n",

      "Foreign currency exposure is a by-product of international investing. When obtaining global asset exposure, investors also obtain the embedded foreign currency exposure. Left unmanaged, this currency exposure acts like a buy-and-hold currency strategy, which receives little or no risk premium and adds unwanted volatility. In “Some Like It Hedged,” the author shows that the impact of foreign currency exposure on institutional portfolios depends significantly on the base currency of the investors and the specific composition of their portfolios. In general, investors whose base currency is negatively correlated with global equities, as are the US dollar and the Japanese yen, will reduce the volatility of their portfolios by fully hedging foreign currency exposure. In contrast, investors whose home currency is positively correlated with global equities, as is the Canadian dollar, will benefit from keeping some unhedged foreign currency exposure—in particular, exposure to the US dollar. Finally, investors with larger allocations to domestic assets will experience only small reductions in volatility from hedging. Pojarliev discusses a variety of options to address foreign currency exposures. Although there is no single best-practice solution for addressing foreign currency exposures, institutional investors have three main choices. The best choice to address foreign currency exposure will differ from institution to institution, but it boils down to two fundamental factors. First, the optimal solution depends on the importance of risk versus return and the institution’s tolerance for negative cash flow. Second, investors must decide whether they believe that currency managers are able to achieve a positive information ratio over the long run after fees and, importantly, whether they will be able to identify these currency managers. Any currency policy will depend on the details of the specific portfolio—in particular, on the base currency of the investor and the size of the foreign currency exposure.\n",

      "The Current State of Quantitative Equity Investing\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantitative equity management is concerned with rigorous, disciplined approaches to help investors structure optimal portfolios to achieve the outcomes they seek. At the root of disciplined, modern investment processes are two things: risk and return. The notion of total return is obvious—price appreciation plus any dividend payments. Risk may not be so straightforward. In most quantitative approaches, risk is viewed as more akin to a roulette wheel; that is, the possible outcomes are well specified and the likelihood of each outcome is known, but in advance, an investor does not know which outcome will be realized. In this piece, we curate the history of quantitative equity investing, which traces its origins to the development of portfolio theory and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). In equities, some of the first quantitative approaches were aimed at confirming the theoretical predictions of the CAPM. In particular, the expected return of a risky asset depends only on the risk of that asset as measured by its beta, a covariance measure of risk. In this paradigm, all investors hold the same risky portfolio, the market portfolio of risky assets that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. At the same time, stock prices are viewed to be informationally efficient and reflecting all available information. By the early 1980s, this simple view of the world was punctured by the discovery of stock market anomalies. Researchers discovered that variables other than beta could explain the cross section of expected returns. In particular, size and value were found to contain useful explanatory power. By the 1990s, the anomalies morphed into the mainstream as the anomalies were re-labeled as factors, and the benchmark model, at least in academic research, was a three-factor model with beta, size, and value. Concurrent with the three-factor model, other credible factors muscled their way into the credible empirical asset pricing world, including momentum, liquidity, quality, and volatility. Indeed, in 2011, the president of the American Finance Association described the proliferation of factors as a “zoo of new factors.”1 Recent work suggests using a much higher standard to accept new factors. With diminishing acceptance of the view that capitalization-weighted indexes are optimal for all investors, factor investing has taken off in practice. Sometime these “smart factors” are called smart beta. Morningstar reported that factor investing is the fastest-growing segment of the investment management marketplace. Investors have recognized that low-cost exposure to other factors might give them superior risk/return trade-offs.

Sometime these “smart factors” are called smart beta. Morningstar reported that factor investing is the fastest-growing segment of the investment management marketplace. Investors have recognized that low-cost exposure to other factors might give them superior risk/return trade-offs. Of course, active investors are still looking for ways to improve performance over more-passive smart beta indexes. In this race, big data approaches offer the potential to grab an insight before it becomes widely known. Another promising avenue is the ability to dynamically adjust allocations to different factors based on the macroeconomic environment and investment conditions. Active managers are also exploring better ways to construct portfolios. In short, quantitative equity management is alive and well and intellectually active as investors seek to better manage risk and return. Commercially, factor investing has taken off in the form of smart beta. Products and strategies, vetted by decades of prior and current research, are continually being developed. One might reasonably forecast that dynamic factor-timing strategies will be a growth area for the quantitative equity field. A new generation of big data approaches is developing in the field and is likely to grow as technology becomes more capable and more data are digitally available. Despite the advances in theory, modeling, and technology, the goal of quantitative equity management techniques is an old one: aiding investors to achieve more efficient and appropriate investment outcomes.\n",

      "Risk Tolerance and Circumstances\n",
      "An investor’s risk attitude is a stable characteristic, like a personality trait, but risk-taking behavior can change based on the investor’s age, recent market events, and life experiences. These factors change investors’ perceptions of the risks. Differences in risk tolerance between men and women or in different circumstances trace back to emotional as much as rational considerations. Financial advisers should consider all of these factors when advising clients and can use four simple steps to incorporate best practices: be aware, educate, nudge, and hand hold.\n",
      "The term risk tolerance is defined and used in different ways. Whether risk tolerance is a stable characteristic of a given investor or also takes into account external circumstances (e.g., economic shocks or the domain of the decision) depends on how it is defined and measured. This brief focuses on a definition of risk tolerance prevalent in the practitioner community—namely, an investor’s willingness to take perceived risk or the trade-off an investor is willing to make between the perceived risk and expected return of different investment choices. This definition derives from a psychological interpretation of the risk–return framework of classical portfolio theory. It treats risk tolerance as an attitude toward risk and decouples this pure attitudinal variable from the perceptions of risks and returns—psychological variables in their own right and distinct from the expected value and variance of the distribution of possible outcomes. Defined in this way, risk tolerance may differ among investors as a function of socioeconomic and biological differences but (with the exception of a brief boost during adolescence) shows stability across an investor’s lifespan, financial shocks, and other circumstances. Risk tolerance, in this sense, is the mediator that translates perceptions of risk and situational needs and constraints into decision and action. The variables that change with market conditions and other circumstances are investors’ perceptions of investment risks and expectations of return. In contrast to risk tolerance, which attaches to an individual and her biological makeup and personality, these variables change over time in response to changing external conditions. Therefore, an investor’s risk-taking behavior (as revealed by her investment decisions) can look like it has changed, despite the stability in her risk tolerance. Perceived risks and expected returns are influenced by hopes and fears as much as by past returns and rational expectations and thus need to be assessed in their own right and possibly corrected. Managing investor emotions through the ups and downs of financial markets is arguably a financial adviser’s most important task. Calm times provide an opportunity to discuss and formulate an investment policy for each client that can be consulted when emotions are running high. Managing risk perceptions requires the financial adviser to act more like a therapist than a mechanic. It is above all about managing expectations and emotions and helping clients to better deal with emotions when it comes to financial decisions. The end result of this process might be a portfolio that is not “optimal” in the sense of modern portfolio theory, with its assumption of econs, but rather a portfolio that “satisfies” the human need for investments that can be handled in the presence of changing emotions and changing risk perceptions.

      "Alternative Investments: A Primer for Investment Professionals provides an overview of alternative investments for institutional asset allocators and other overseers of portfolios containing both traditional and alternative assets. It is designed for those with substantial experience regarding traditional investments in stocks and bonds but limited familiarity regarding alternative assets, alternative strategies, and alternative portfolio management. The primer categorizes alternative assets into four groups: hedge funds, real assets, private equity, and structured products/derivatives. Real assets include vacant land, farmland, timber, infrastructure, intellectual property, commodities, and private real estate. For each group, the primer provides essential information about the characteristics, challenges, and purposes of these institutional-quality alternative assets in the context of a well-diversified institutional portfolio. Other topics addressed by this primer include tail risk, due diligence of the investment process and operations, measurement and management of risks and returns, setting return expectations, and portfolio construction. The primer concludes with a chapter on the case for investing in alternatives.\n",

      "A fast growing share of investors have recently widened their scope of analysis to criteria regarded as extra-financial. They are driven by different motivations. Adoption of sustainable investment strategies can be driven, on the one hand by the sole motivation to hedge portfolios against knowable risks by expanding the conceptual framework to incorporate the latest best practice in risk management. Other investors focus rather on a long-term view and make an active bet on societal change. Recent empirical research has shown that considering sustainability factors within investment practices does not come at a cost (i.e. through a reduced opportunity set) but allows for competitive returns. Furthermore, the growing market and resulting competition in the wake of sustainable investing going mainstream has the welcome effect to compress fees for such products. Hence, staying informed about recent trends in sustainable investing is imperative no matter what the main motivation is.\n",

      "The price at which a stock is traded in the market reflects the ability of the firm to generate cash flow and the risks associated with generating the expected future cash flows. The authors point to the limits of widely used valuation techniques. The most important of these limits is the inability to forecast cash flows and to determine the appropriate discount rate. Another important limit is the inability to determine absolute value. Widely used valuation techniques such as market multiples - the price-to-earnings ratio, firm value multiples or a use of multiple ratios, for example - capture only relative value, that is, the value of a firm's stocks related to the value of comparable firms (assuming that comparable firms can be identified). The study underlines additional problems when it comes to valuing IPOs and private equity: Both are sensitive to the timing of the offer, suffer from information asymmetry, and are more subject to behavioral elements than is the case for shares of listed firms. In the case of IPOs in particular, the authors discuss how communication strategies and media hype play an important role in the IPO valuation/pricing process.\n",

      "Risk profiling is one of the most fundamental aspects of determining a suitable investment solution for an individual. It is also one of the most misunderstood. This situation results in many ill-advised approaches, both to determining various components of a client’s risk profile and to using them in arriving at an appropriate solution. Among these ill-advised approaches are Much of the problem lies in the rather imprecise and ambiguous way the industry uses the terminology around risk profiling, with terms such as risk tolerance, risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk attitude applied to a range of different concepts in different parts of the world, in different organisations, and, indeed, sometimes within an organisation in different conversations with a single client. Much of the problem lies in the rather imprecise and ambiguous way the industry uses the terminology around risk profiling, with terms such as risk tolerance, risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk attitude applied to a range of different concepts in different parts of the world, in different organisations, and, indeed, sometimes within an organisation in different conversations with a single client. However, even where terminology is stable, there are areas of confusion. For example, the industry lacks a coherent model of risk capacity and how it relates to risk tolerance (both as defined below). What gets measured gets managed, so risk tolerance is frequently called on to do much more work than it should in determining a suitable portfolio solution. Though a full model of risk capacity is beyond the scope of this article, it does have implications for how we think about risk tolerance and how we go about measuring it. Also, there is a frequent tendency to use short-term behavioural responses in “optimising” a portfolio—that is, building a portfolio solution around the assumption that an investor’s observed behaviour is somehow “desirable” and should be used as an input to the optimization process. Instead, one should try to make clients more comfortable with a long-term approach that treats such responses as undesirable. For example, attempts to use loss aversion or ambiguity aversion as inputs into an optimal portfolio solution often fail to recognize that there are aspects of risk attitudes that are helpful in determining the “right” investment and that there are aspects that are harmful. We should help investors to overcome the harmful ones to prevent their behavioural responses from getting in the way of good long-term outcomes. These aspects of the client’s overall risk profile should refine, not define, the investment solution. In the first part of this article, I shall discuss how we should think about the crucial elements of (a) risk tolerance, (b) behavioural risk attitudes, and (c) risk capacity. In the second, I use a simple thought experiment to examine a stripped-down investor situation and define the essential features and exact role of each of the components of an investor’s overall risk profile. In doing so, I shall use terminology that is broadly consistent with that used by regulators to stipulate how each concept should be used in delivering a suitable investment solution. For example, risk tolerance will refer to that subcomponent of risk attitudes that should be used in determining the long-term “right” investment solution, rather than to any attitude toward risk that the investor happens to have over the investment journey. Others may choose to apply different terms to concepts unearthed in the thought experiment; sadly, I suspect a globally consistent terminology might be too much to hope for. But if we can at least reach agreement on what the essential components are, however named, then we will have made progress. Armed with a clear distinction of what we mean by the various elements of risk profiling, it becomes a much simpler task to ask how we might best go about eliciting these elements. The final part of the article will examine options for eliciting and measuring risk tolerance and will consider some promising avenues for future methods.\n",

The structured products industry is so big and so diverse that it is helpful to break it down into three parts. The choice of instrument is predicated on such considerations as tax efficiency and convenience. Some popular structured products are: The structured products industry is large enough and complicated enough that it should be examined by anyone involved or interested in finance and capital markets.

      "Interaction between finance and technology is not novel. The abacus is a testament to the long-standing relationship between the two. But the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) represented a pivotal moment that separated prior phases of the development of financial technology (FinTech) and regulatory technology (RegTech) from the current paradigm. Today, FinTech has entered a phase of rapid development marked by the proliferation of startups and other new entrants, such as IT and ecommerce firms that have fragmented the financial services market. This new era presents fresh challenges for regulators and highlights why the evolution of FinTech necessitates a parallel development of RegTech. In particular, regulators must develop a robust new framework that promotes innovation and market confidence, aided by the use of regulatory \"sandboxes.\" Currently in its second stage of development, RegTech is being used by both institutions and regulators to address increasingly cumbersome compliance processes. But regulators have yet to unlock the transformative potential of RegTech. We argue that certain RegTech developments today are highlighting the path toward another paradigm shift, which will be typified by a reconceptualization of the nature of financial regulation. This \"RegTech 3.0\" will involve a regulatory approach that is as datacentric as the markets it monitors.\n",

      "The concept of risk, and the specific evaluation of risk attitudes and risk taking, has a long and colorful history. Bernstein (1996) wrote the seminal review of the history of risk, pointing out that the concept of risk being related to outcome probabilities goes back more than 800 years. The first major breakthrough in thinking about risk, however, occurred in 1738 when Daniel Bernoulli used his knowledge of probabilities to uncover an important relationship between wealth and risk taking. He concluded that individuals prefer to take less risk and that they demand greater potential returns to engage in risky activities. Bernoulli’s work laid the foundation for the development of expected utility theory and modern portfolio management principles. However, challenges to assumptions imbedded in the standard utility function began to emerge shortly after World War II. The notion that individuals, when dealing with financial decisions, always make rational choices across scenarios could not be fully supported empirically. The first systematic risk attitude measurements were developed in the late 1950s. Kogan and Wallach (1964), for example, created the choice dilemma questionnaire, which remained a standard paradigm for the next 30 years. Their assessment tool was based on asking respondents to indicate the lowest probability of success required to undertake a risky choice in 12 scenarios dealing with a multitude of contexts. The data demonstrated that choice dilemmas did not do a consistently good job at explaining or predicting an individual’s behavior (Kamalanabhan, Sunder, and Vasanthi 2000), particularly in the domain of investment and financial planning. As behavioral economics and behavior finance gained traction as fields of study, researchers and investment professionals justifiably began to question both traditional models of economic behavior and the tools used to evaluate client attitudes. A general skepticism regarding existing frameworks led to the publication of a handful of validated financial risk-tolerance assessment instruments in the 1980s (MacCrimmon and Wehrung 1984;The American College 1994). Since that time, dozens (if not hundreds) of tools have emerged to evaluate an individual’s willingness to engage in a financial behavior in which at least one outcome is both unknown and potentially negative. Nearly all of these instruments have been designed by practitioners and firms. Unfortunately, few risk-tolerance assessment tests have been created using recognized test theory principles. This review provides financial analysts, investment professionals, and financial planners with an examination of how financial risk-tolerance tests can and should be evaluated. The review begins by clarifying terms related to risk taking. A broad overview of two important measurement terms, validity and reliability, follows. The review concludes with examples for practice.

      "Impact of Reporting Frequency on UK Public Companies\n",
      "Beginning in 2007, UK public companies were required to issue quarterly, rather than semiannual, financial reports. But the UK removed this quarterly reporting requirement in 2014. We studied the effects of these regulatory changes on UK public companies and found that the frequency of financial reports had no material impact on levels of corporate investment. However, mandatory quarterly reporting was associated with an increase in analyst coverage and an improvement in the accuracy of analyst earnings forecasts.\n",
      "Authors’ Note: This study was financed in part by a grant from the CFA Institute Research Foundation. The authors express deep appreciation to Emilio Lamar, an MIT senior, for his excellent work on the references. Corporate executives have long decried the undue emphasis on short-termism—defined as maximizing corporate profits in the next quarter. Instead, most corporate executives say that they want to make corporate investments from a long-term perspective—defined as enhancing corporate value over a period of three to five years (Rappaport 2006). This concern about favoring short-termism over long-termism has now spread to institutional investors (Perrin 2016). In an open letter, Lawrence Fink, CEO of BlackRock, warned US companies that they may be harming their long-term value by capitulating to pressures from activist hedge funds to increase dividends or share buybacks in the short term (Fink 2015). In response, commentators and regulators have proposed a broad range of remedies to curb short-termism in corporate America (Pozen 2014). These proposals include, but are not limited to, higher taxes on short-term trading, faster filings for groups acquiring more than 5% of a company’s voting stock, reduced say by institutional investors in managerial decisions, and increased voting rights for shareholders based on the length of their holding period. In response, commentators and regulators have proposed a broad range of remedies to curb short-termism in corporate America (Pozen 2014). These proposals include, but are not limited to, higher taxes on short-term trading, faster filings for groups acquiring more than 5% of a company’s voting stock, reduced say by institutional investors in managerial decisions, and increased voting rights for shareholders based on the length of their holding period. Of particular interest to CFA members are the calls for public companies to issue earnings reports on a semiannual rather than quarterly basis. This proposal was put forth by a distinguished American lawyer (Benoit 2015) and was discussed at a recent SEC hearing (SEC 2015). Even former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has expressed concern about the adverse effects of quarterly reporting on the long-term profitability of American corporations (Udland 2016). Over the last decade or so, Europe has engaged in a “natural experiment” on the effects of reporting frequency. In its 2004 Transparency Directive, the European Commission announced that by early 2007 all EU member states must require their public companies to issue interim management statements (IMS) on a quarterly basis (European Parliament and Council 2004). However, in its 2013 amendments to the directive, the European Commission reversed direction by removing this requirement (European Commission 2013). We undertook this study to assess the actual impact of the frequency of company reporting on UK public companies. Specifically, this study looked at the effects on UK corporate investments and capital markets of moving to required quarterly reporting in 2007 and then dropping this requirement in 2014. Most importantly, this study found that the initiation of required quarterly reporting in 2007 had no material impact on the investment decisions of UK public companies. As discussed in Section 2A, the study measured this impact by examining, before and after these changes in reporting requirements, the companies’ capital expenditures; spending on research and development; and spending on property, plant, and equipment. By contrast, the initiation of mandatory quarterly reporting in 2007 was associated with significant changes in other areas. An increasing number of companies published more qualitative than quantitative quarterly reports and gave managerial guidance about future company earnings or sales. At the same time, there was an increase in analyst coverage of public companies and an improvement in the accuracy of analyst forecasts of company earnings. When quarterly reporting was no longer required of UK companies in 2014, less than 10% stopped issuing quarterly reports (as of the end of 2015). Again, there was no statistically significant difference between the levels of corporate investment of the UK companies that stopped quarterly reporting and those that continued quarterly reporting. However, there was a general decline in the analyst coverage of stoppers and less of such decline for companies continuing to report quarterly. Companies that stopped quarterly reporting manifested two characteristics: They were relatively small by market capitalization, and they did not issue managerial guidance during the period of mandatory quarterly reporting. Energy companies were the most prevalent stoppers, followed by utilities. This brief is organized into four parts, plus a final section on “Conclusions and Implications”:\n",

We believe that simplicity and modularity lend substantial robustness to investment analysis.

      "In the last year, CFA Institute, along with many professional organizations, began to look more closely at the composition of its membership. We found a surprising number: Women represent less than one in five CFA® charterholders. Why would this be? The most enduring principle of sound investment management is diversification, yet it is remarkably absent from team construction across all spectrums of the investment profession. Can we improve investor outcomes through increased diversity in general, starting with the gender gap? The idea that gender diverse teams have better outcomes in terms of corporate earnings and investment returns has been the subject of a growing number of industry papers1 and even some new investment products, although academic findings to date have been mixed.2 Furthermore, this is a topic that centers around firm culture, an important but understudied subject in the financial industry,3 and a lot of the work around cognitive diversity or collective intelligence has been done in other fields.4 Now, however, culture as a competitive edge is a growing area of interest in the investment industry, and the subject is of increasing concern to regulators of financial firms as well. Senior leaders across the industry who are adept at solving difficult problems have told us they can’t seem to make progress in terms of attracting and retaining women investment professionals. Now, however, culture as a competitive edge is a growing area of interest in the investment industry, and the subject is of increasing concern to regulators of financial firms as well. Senior leaders across the industry who are adept at solving difficult problems have told us they can’t seem to make progress in terms of attracting and retaining women investment professionals. To uncover some of the underlying causes of the gender disparity in investment management, we developed a survey in consultation with finance scholars Renee Adams, Brad Barber, and Terrance Odean. We drew some questions from surveys conducted of the general population, which then allowed us to compare views of men and women generally with views of men and women in the investment profession, using CFA Institute members as a proxy for the profession. We sent the survey to our membership in May 2016 and received responses from over 5,000 CFA members (more than 4,000 men and more than 1,000 women). Adams, Barber, and Odean then analyzed the anonymized CFA survey data and compared the survey results with several additional datasets to investigate the question of why women are underrepresented in this field. The result of their efforts is the working paper titled “Family, Values, and Women in Finance” (2016) available on SSRN.5 Although we anticipate additional research will be generated from this dataset, the initial working paper provides an important first step in understanding the factors that modulate gender representation in investing. In this executive summary, we highlight some key findings from the May 2016 CFA institute survey and Adams et al.\n",

      "On 8 October 2015, CFA Montréal hosted its annual Asset Allocation Forum under the theme “Portfolio Structuring and the Value of Forecasting.” Two asset management approaches were compared: Traditional asset management has sustained much criticism in recent years. Few active managers outperform their benchmark after fees over longer time horizons, such as 5 to 10 years. There has been much empirical evidence supporting the view that professional forecasters cannot predict or that their predictions explain only a very small part of the variability of asset returns. Hence, many investors are starting to embrace factor investing, which is becoming more commoditized and is often accessible at a lower cost. However, even the factor investing approach relies on forecasts of expected returns, although the forecasts are implicit. Factor investors are not forecasting that the utility sector is likely to outperform the energy sector by X% over the next year (an explicit forecast), but they make the implicit forecast that, for example, value stocks are likely to outperform growth stocks in the long run. Hence, both approaches rely on some form of forecasting. The objective of this forum was to shed some light on the factor investing approach, often called “smart beta,” while discussing recent developments in forecasting capabilities that may spur renewed interest in traditional asset management approaches. The objective of this forum was to shed some light on the factor investing approach, often called “smart beta,” while discussing recent developments in forecasting capabilities that may spur renewed interest in traditional asset management approaches. The conference attracted five top speakers in their respective field. Two of these speakers discussed the factor approach—Andrew Ang of BlackRock and Mark Carhart, CFA, of Kepos Capital. The other three speakers discussed our ability to predict—Craig Bodenstab, CFA, of Orbis, David Rapach of Saint Louis University, and Philip E. Tetlock of the University of Pennsylvania. Each speaker wrote up the most important aspects of his speech, and the write-ups are included in this brief.\n",

      "The true meaning of investment discipline is to trade only when you rationally expect that you will achieve your desired objective. Accordingly, managers must thoroughly understand why they trade. Because trading is a zero-sum game, good investment discipline also requires that managers understand why their counterparties trade. This book surveys the many reasons why people trade and identifies the implications of the zero-sum game for investment discipline. It also identifies the origins of liquidity and thus of transaction costs, as well as when active investment strategies are profitable. The book then explains how managers must measure and control transaction costs to perform well. Electronic trading systems and electronic trading strategies now dominate trading in exchange markets throughout the world. The book identifies why speed is of such great importance to electronic traders, how they obtain it, and the trading strategies they use to exploit it. Finally, the book analyzes many issues associated with electronic trading that currently concern practitioners and regulators.\n",

The existing research in risk profiling shows, however, that several factors can provide more accurate and reliable insights into the risk profile of investors. Among these factors are the lifetime experiences an investor has had, the financial decisions made in the past, and the influence of family and friends as well as advisers. By using these factors, practitioners can get a better understanding of their clients’ preferences in order to recommend suitable investment strategies and products.\n",

      "The Principal–Agent Problem in Finance\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its prominence in economics today, the study of incentives is relatively new. Included in this field is the study of the principal–agent relationship. The principal is one who, within predefined terms, assigns a task to an agent, who performs the task on the principal’s behalf. If the agent’s incentives are not aligned with those of the principal and the principal cannot monitor the agent’s actions, the agent has both the motivation and the ability to act undetected against the principal’s interests. This scenario is referred to as the “principal–agent problem.” Early in the history of economics, researchers focused primarily on the behavior of market participants on an aggregate level. Ronald Coase is widely credited with taking the analysis one level deeper in the 1930s with his examination of the firm. In the 1950s and 1960s, economists began to examine how differences in incentives among members of a given team cause the various members to act differently from each other, sparking the subdiscipline of economics known as “optimal contract theory.” At the same time, another set of economists, including Robert Wilson and Kenneth Arrow, were exploring the nature of risk sharing among groups of people with different preferences for risk. Such studies brought to light a set of difficulties that can occur when parties to a contract involving risk transfer alter their actions after the contract is agreed upon. This area of work came to be known as “agency theory.” These two lines of study share a common thread: Each party to a contract must recognize that the other parties may change their behavior after the contract has been struck. The key question is how to structure the contract to minimize potential problems. These two fields eventually merged, and from this union, the principal–agent model and the study of the principal–agent problem were born. These two lines of study share a common thread: Each party to a contract must recognize that the other parties may change their behavior after the contract has been struck. The key question is how to structure the contract to minimize potential problems. These two fields eventually merged, and from this union, the principal–agent model and the study of the principal–agent problem were born. For the principal–agent relationship to be problematic, two ingredients are needed: conflicting incentives and private information. Without the former, the principal may simply leave the agent to his or her own devices; without the latter, the principal need only structure the contract to cover each realization of private information ex post. It is not surprising that the financial services industry finds itself rife with potential principal–agent problems. The interconnectedness of the industry has created a myriad of agency relationships in which monitoring is difficult, and many of these relationships involve risk transfer or risk sharing within groups. Consequently, ethical standards within the field must be high, lest the power of participants’ own incentives drive them to act counter to their fiduciary duty to their clients. Unfortunately, strong ethical standards have not been upheld. As several studies have shown, many participants in the finance industry who have witnessed wrongdoing do not report it and, worse yet, many would engage in illegal activity to get ahead if they were sure they would not be caught. These patterns exist even though other studies have shown that trust is the attribute that is most important to investors when hiring investment managers—even more important than an ability to achieve high returns. Examining the literature that discusses such problems in two important areas of finance, asset management and the banking industry, is an important step in promoting the introspection needed to reevaluate the industry’s practices.\n",

      "Population growth, industrialization, and urbanization in the past 200 years have resulted in local, national, and global pollution of our environment. Fossil-fuel combustion has resulted in rising levels of pollutants that cause smog, acid rain, and climate changes. Entire populations are faced with inadequate access to clean air and water, including China, India, Africa, and large areas elsewhere in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of ownership of air and water is the cause of the problem. The profit maximization model for a firm takes into account only the direct costs incurred by the firm, not the spillover costs, such as the negative repercussions associated with the pollution of air and water. Therefore, more goods and services are produced than would be if pollution were either controlled by fiat or internally priced (a condition in which the social, or external, cost of the pollution is figured into the decision about how much of the good or service to produce).1\n",
      "\n",
      "These spillover costs, called “negative externalities,” can be dealt with by mandating limits on pollutants (i.e., a cap) or requiring specific modifications in the production of goods and services. Spillover costs or benefits can also be mitigated by taxes and/or subsidies designed to drive down the level of pollution. In addition, externalities can be mitigated when public or private entities create a limited number of pollution or use rights corresponding to the environmentally acceptable cap on the pollutant. These property rights, called “allowances,” can be purchased by companies for the purpose of compliance with environmental laws if they exceed their individual caps. Companies that reduce emissions in excess of their targeted caps can sell their allowances. The creation of a limited number (a cap) of property rights and their transferability (trade) has come to be known as “cap-and-trade.” The transferability of allowances results in the market putting a price on the right to pollute. The price discovery allows companies flexibility to choose an efficient way to reduce pollution. When the price is higher than the technology required to reduce or eliminate the pollution, companies will install the technology. If the opposite is the case, they will buy allowances. The price signals and flexibility enabled by a cap-and-trade program result in a least-cost solution to environmental problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The role of markets in reducing pollution and environmental degradation is not widely understood. Markets, when designed properly, can be a powerful agent for social and environmental transformation. These markets also act as economic drivers, generating jobs and improving the overall quality of life while acting as catalysts for innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early program outcomes, such as the phasing out of leaded gasoline and the virtual elimination of acid rain, led to widespread adoption of cap-and-trade throughout the world. The result has been creation of a new asset class—the environment—to join the traditional asset classes of stocks, bonds, real estate, foreign exchange, and tangible commodities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environmental asset classes are not a hope for tomorrow but a reality today. This new asset category promises to grow dramatically. Examples of environmental assets are rights to emit local and regional pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide; rights to emit global pollutants, such as carbon dioxide; renewable energy credits; water quality and quantity rights; catastrophe and weather risk; and indices of sustainable corporate equities. This new asset class is the manifestation in securities and commodities markets of an emerging field of endeavor called “environmental finance.” Environmental finance is the art and science of using economic incentives, financial tools, and market mechanisms to achieve desired environmental outcomes.2\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is born out of economic theory and practical experience. Its purpose is to introduce this new asset class to financial analysts, investors, and corporations. It is of interest to these readers because it allows them to maximize revenues, reduce costs, and manage risks while promoting environmental and social benefits. Here is a new way to “do well and to do good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "From a corporate standpoint, businesses today have to be cognizant of, and prepare for, new kinds of corporate risks, including those arising from environmental problems and resource scarcity. These environmental risks include those related to production inputs (e.g., clean water for a beverage company), by-products of production (e.g., wastewater from chemical processing), and corporate social responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, for companies to be competitive, their executives must be aware of opportunities that environmental markets have to offer. Environmental asset classes allow businesses to pursue major new opportunities while simultaneously achieving their energy and environmental goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, financial analysts need to understand emerging environmental asset classes to evaluate companies on the basis of their environmental performance, exposure to environmental risks, and response to environmental opportunities. Portfolio managers may also want to incorporate these new asset classes in their portfolios.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eight chapters of this book cover three broad asset classes: air and water, catastrophe and weather risk, and sustainability. The discussions also demonstrate how the environmental asset classes are being incorporated into commodities, fixed income, and equity instruments. The book concludes with some insights into the current state of this emerging asset class, some food for thought, and predictions about the future of environmental assets. We hope that the reader will walk away with a solid preliminary understanding of the promising and transformational new investment category of environmental assets.\n",

      "Manager selection is a critical step in implementing any investment program. Even though investment objectives may be finalized and targets for asset class weights set, an investment plan is not productive until it is implemented through the purchase or sale of securities, properties, commodities, and derivatives. In most cases, investors choose portfolio managers to determine the most appropriate instruments in which to place assets. Investors hire portfolio managers to act as their agents, and portfolio managers are trusted to perform to the best of their abilities and in the investors’ best interests.\n",

      "Investors must practice due diligence when selecting index managers or active portfolio managers.

It highlights the influence that investment policy statements have on manager selection and proposes techniques for hiring active, indexed, and alternative managers.

      "Derivative securities and markets have experienced tremendous worldwide growth since 1970. But even so, they are not always well understood. To remedy this situation, the authors explain the link between options and futures and the underlying security or index from which they ultimately derive their value. Pricing and hedging relationships of futures contracts, option characteristics and strategies, and option pricing and hedging relationships are also addressed. To further assist the reader, the authors include exercises to reinforce the concepts as well as a glossary. The result is an updated look at options and futures that can benefit many of us.\n",

      "The ethical issues that financial professionals face are no different from the ethical issues in any profession—or, indeed, the day-to-day dilemmas we all face. These issues are readily resolved through the use of three simple questions: Does this violate the law? Is this honest? What if I were on the other side? These three basic ethical standards are often complicated, extrapolated, rationalized, refined, and confused as those in the financial markets grapple with what they believe are more complex ethical issues today than in the past. But as this review shows, the ethical issues in the financial markets today are no different from those that managers of money and assets, financial advisers, and analysts have faced over the centuries.\n",

      "The authors of this book examine the rationale for investing in currency. They highlight several features of currency returns that make currency an attractive asset class for institutional investors. Using style factors to model currency returns provides a natural way to decompose returns into alpha and beta components. They find that several established currency trading strategies (variants of carry, trend-following, and value strategies) produce consistent returns that can be proxied as style or risk factors and have the nature of beta returns. Then, using two datasets of returns of actual currency hedge funds, they find that some currency managers produce true alpha. Finally, they find that adding to an institutional investor’s portfolio even a small amount of currency exposure—particularly to alpha generators—can make a meaningful positive impact on the portfolio’s performance.\n",

      "Third in the series of Boston University–sponsored conferences titled “The Future of Life-Cycle Saving and Investing,” the May 2011 conference again brought together academic researchers, educators, advisers, and regulators. This time, we analyzed the gaps in consumers’ current financial knowledge, how those gaps might be narrowed through financial education programs, and how consumer protection regarding financial products might be strengthened—with a focus on low- and middle-income households. Although there was general agreement that consumers of financial products and services make many costly mistakes, there was also considerable disagreement about relying primarily on consumer financial education programs to correct those mistakes.\n",

      "Economic growth depends on the efficient allocation of resources, including the two main factors of production: labor and capital. Markets, operating on each factor, have allocated these resources in economies worldwide in ways that arguably approach optimality and have fostered economic development for the benefit of billions. Capital markets, both for debt and equity securities, have allowed firms to secure funding for productive uses while providing investors with opportunities for portfolio diversification. The importance of capital markets for the development of economies and for the betterment of society cannot be overstated. This is just as true in emerging economies with free markets, such as those found in Latin America, as it is in developed markets. However, capital markets in the region are not being utilized to the fullest. What challenges face Latin American countries in the development of their local capital markets? How can these countries unlock the true potential of their markets and thus spur growth? The idea behind this collection of articles is to offer a primer on the development of local capital markets in several select countries in Latin America. We discuss not only their history and current status but also their future. To this end, seven authors contributed to this project, each writing about one of seven countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay. Each author decided which issues they believe matter most to the progress of their local capital markets. Some authors chose a qualitative and institutional description of local markets, whereas others adopted a more quantitative approach. Lionel Modi, CFA, provides an account of the recent evolution of capital markets in Argentina and identifies five stages in their development, culminating with the current stage that has prevailed since 2015. As Mr. Modi shows, in 2016, Argentina emerged from the international debt default status into which it fell in the early 2000s. This recovery was fundamental for attracting foreign investors to Argentina’s local markets. His article discusses the main asset classes that exist in Argentina and points out that political commitment and market, tax, and pension system reforms in Argentina will be key to the future growth of its capital markets.

This recovery was fundamental for attracting foreign investors to Argentina’s local markets. His article discusses the main asset classes that exist in Argentina and points out that political commitment and market, tax, and pension system reforms in Argentina will be key to the future growth of its capital markets. I discuss Brazil’s equity and debt capital markets in an article that starts with a brief outline of the way these markets evolved over the past several decades. Although important advancements have occurred in the development of the country’s capital markets, macroeconomic issues—including high interest rates, fiscal indiscipline, and the crowding out of private capital markets by public issuance—have constantly challenged such progress. Progress in Brazil also depends on more efficient regulations and financial education. I argue that some of the necessary conditions for the accelerated growth and development of Brazil’s capital markets are already in place, so stakeholders must take advantage of current opportunities. Nicolás Álvarez, CFA, covers the local fixed-income market in Chile. After providing information about the characteristics of, and main players in, that market, Mr. Álvarez offers a quantitative analysis of how the market is integrated with international markets in terms of price co-movement. He also discusses recent changes in the Chilean regulatory environment and indicates that both administrative and tax reporting requirements are now friendlier to investors, especially foreign ones. Challenges that need to be tackled in Chile include the dominance of pension funds and the effect of such dominance on market liquidity and international integration. César Cuervo, CFA, begins his article on Colombia by stating that there is ample room for growth and improvement in that country’s local capital markets. He discusses several issues that are essential to making Colombian capital markets more functional and efficient. Although the local equity market is underdeveloped in terms of the ratio of market capitalization to GDP, the local fixed-income market is relatively robust and liquid, albeit more on the government side than on the corporate side. Mr. Cuervo lists stronger regulator supervision, more formalization in the economy, and better governance regarding voting and nonvoting shares—as well as other changes—as prerequisites for stronger and deeper capital markets in Colombia. Jorge Unda, CFA, discusses Mexico’s recent financial history and its impact on the development of the country’s local capital markets. He acknowledges that important structural changes have taken place in the last two decades, including pension reform, the creation of a benchmark yield curve, consolidation in the banking sector, and a commitment to macroeconomic prudence. Although the crowding-out effect exists in Mexico, Mr. Unda argues that the participation of foreign investors has mitigated it. However, predicting the long-term impact of some recent reforms, including those of 2014, is difficult. For Mexico, the key to capital market development—and economic growth—seems to lie with the expansion of credit. The recent development of the local capital markets in Peru is the theme of Melvin Escudero’s article. He argues that a combination of excessive regulation, tax structure, and the predominance of banks in financing activities provides a disincentive for companies to tap the capital markets, affecting the supply side of securities. In addition, the absence of a financial culture, a preference for foreign assets, and taxes on income and capital gains on capital market securities (while bank instruments are tax exempt) have negatively affected the demand side. Given these circumstances, it is not surprising that liquidity in the Peruvian capital markets is thin. Governmental and private sector initiatives are needed to improve this scenario. Barbara Mainzer, CFA, examines the features that make Uruguay a stable and reliable international center for business. Ms. Mainzer points out that, although the country has a long history in the financial markets, its capital markets are less developed than those of other countries in the region because of the small size of companies, corporate governance issues, and regulatory weaknesses. The primary market is more important than secondary markets, and the issuance and amount of government debt dwarf those of private debt. Still, the high-income investor base, government incentives, and increased participation of private pension funds are attractive elements that can promote the development of local capital markets in Uruguay. Although capital markets in the countries discussed in this brief differ in their distinctive characteristics, stages of development, and relevance to the local economy, the articles collected here show that these nations share some familiar challenges, including the considerable size of the government bond markets, inadequate or insufficient regulatory oversight, and cultural characteristics that lead investors to look for investment opportunities elsewhere. The articles also share some potential solutions for promoting the accelerated development of local markets, such as economic reforms, increased regulatory efficiency, improved governance, and greater internationalization. I hope that this publication will add to the debate on how to improve local capital markets and will encourage all stakeholders—especially issuers, investors, and regulators—to collaborate in proposing and implementing those solutions for the benefit of society.\n",
