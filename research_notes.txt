According to the context, CUDA Graphs leads to substantial performance improvement by removing the GPU-side launch overheads associated with each kernel launch. By submitting all kernels as part of the same computational graph with a single CUDA API launch call, CUDA Graphs vastly reduces the overheads associated with GPU activities. This is particularly beneficial for small problems on fast GPUs, where launch overheads are most relevant.

Question: how does CUDA graph lead to substiantain performance?
Response: According to the context, CUDA Graphs leads to substantial performance improvement by removing the GPU-side launch overheads associated with each kernel launch. By scheduling multiple GPU activities as a single computational graph, CUDA Graphs reduces the overheads that accumulate when each activity is separately scheduled (launched) by the CPU. This is evident in Figure 2, where the overheads associated with GPU activities are vastly reduced with CUDA Graphs. Specifically, the removal of launch overheads with CUDA Graphs leads to a speedup of up to 1.2x for the smallest Llama 7B model on the fastest NVIDIA H100 GPUs.
